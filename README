SUMMARY:

This is a quick and dirty copy of Solaris' mkfile command, initially
written for Linux, but it should compile under any recent Unix.

It is used to make a empty file of specified size, e.g...

	$ mkfile -G 100 foo ; ls -l foo
	-rw-r--r-- 1 chris users 107374182400 2010-08-15 19:41 foo

USAGE:
	$ mkfile -h
	Usage: mkfile [options] size file
	Create a sparse file of specific size.
	If unit is not specified, size is in bytes.
	Options:
	  -v : verbose
	  -h : this help
	Size factors (specify only one of -k,-M,-G,-T):
	  -k : size is in kibibyte (2^10=1024 byte)
	  -M : size is in Mebibyte (2^20=1048576 byte)
	  -G : size is in Gibibyte (2^30=1073741824 byte)
	  -T : size is in Tebibyte (2^40=1099511627776 byte)

BUILDING:

	just type make
	make install will install the binary in /usr/local/bin,
		the maual page will be copied to /local/share/man/man1

	Compiles cleanly under:

		Linux (Ubuntu Karmic)
		OpenSolaris (b134 or so)
		MacOSX (Snow Leopard 10.6.4, x86, thanks Morgan!)
